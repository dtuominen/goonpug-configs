 * Each admin should have its own "Admin" section, followed by a name.
 * The name does not have to be unique.
 *
 * Available properties: (Anything else is filtered as custom)

 *                        "steam"  - Steam based authentication
 *                        "name"   - Name based authentication
 *                        "ip"	- IP based authentication
 *                        Anything else is treated as custom.
 *					 Note: Only one auth method is allowed per entry.
 *

 *					 Note: Only one identity is allowed per entry.
